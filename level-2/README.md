# Whats is state
In React, "state" is a fundamental concept used to manage and store data that can change over time within a component. It allows components to be dynamic and responsive. State is initialized in a component's constructor for class-based components or using the `useState` hook for functional components. You can update state by using specific functions, such as `this.setState` in class components or the state update function returned by `useState` in functional components. State values are used in the component's render method to display dynamic content based on the current state, enabling the creation of interactive user interfaces.
# Difference between states and props
1. **State**: State is a concept within React used to manage and store data that can change over time in a component. It allows components to be dynamic and responsive, and it is used to store and track information that may change due to user interactions or data updates.

2. **React**: React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It provides a framework for creating interactive and dynamic web applications. React allows you to define UI components, manage their state, and efficiently update the user interface when the state changes. State is a core concept within React used to achieve this reactivity and interactivity in your applications.

# How to nest elements in react ,explain in code 
To nest elements in a React component, you can include one element within another element just like you would with regular HTML. Here's a summary of how to nest elements in React code:

1. **Create a parent component**: Begin by defining a parent component, which can include one or more child elements.

2. **Nest child elements**: Inside the parent component's render method (for class components) or JSX (for functional components), you can nest child elements within the parent element.

Here's an example using a functional component in React:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function ParentComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>This is the Parent Component</h1>
      <p>Parent component content goes here.</p>
      <ChildComponent />
    </div>
  );
}

function ChildComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>This is the Child Component</h2>
      <p>Child component content goes here.</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default ParentComponent;
```

In the code above, `ParentComponent` is the parent component, and it nests `ChildComponent` within it. You can include as many child components as needed within the parent component to create a hierarchy of nested elements.
import React from 'react';

function ParentComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>This is the Parent Component</h1>
      <p>Parent component content goes here.</p>
      <ChildComponent />
    </div>
  );
}

function ChildComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>This is the Child Component</h2>
      <p>Child component content goes here.</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default ParentComponent;

# Rules of working with hooks
When working with hooks in React, follow these key rules:

1. Use hooks in functional components, not in class components.
2. Call hooks at the top level of a component or custom hook.
3. Ensure that hooks are called in the same order on each render.
4. Avoid conditional hook calls within a component.
5. Create custom hooks for reusable logic.
6. Don't call hooks from regular JavaScript functions.
7. Be careful with side effects in `useEffect`, specifying dependencies accurately.
8. Prefix custom hook names with "use" to follow naming conventions.
9. Understand and correctly list dependencies in the `useEffect` and `useMemo` dependency arrays.
10. Familiarize yourself with the documentation of the hooks you use to understand their behavior and best practices.gi
